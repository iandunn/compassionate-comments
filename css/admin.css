		/* todo that's 4 lines of text, which works at desktop but not lower. maybe use media queries of JS to set to right height based on how many lines X chars would take up in the current size? calc() or something? */
		/* longest entry is 280 characters, and need to figure out how many lines that will take up given the current width of the blockquote
		maybe create a hidden div inside the card, then set the content to be 280 chars long, the get the height?

		probably not an elegant way to do this, maybe just stick w/ 8em since it's big enough for all breakpoints. not perfect but simple.
